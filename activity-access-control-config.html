For example, you can create access controls to ensure users can only make changes to activities within their department or region, or to prevent specific users from seeing any details at all about certain activities.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_9">By creating access controls and assigning them to your users, you can ensure that users only have access to the activity details and functionality they need. This helps to protect sensitive or privileged information, and maintains data integrity by preventing unauthorized changes.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="how-do-activity-access-controls-work" data-toc="how-do-activity-access-controls-work">How do activity access controls work?</h2><p id="-mgg4lf_13">Uptempo Campaign Management uses the &quot;deny by default&quot; principle for activity access control, which means that users have no access to any activity by default. Instead, administrators must grant users explicit permission to access and interact with activities. To do this, administrators create <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_16">policies</span> and <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_17">statements</span> that define these permissions and apply them to users.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="policies" data-toc="policies">Policies</h3><p id="-mgg4lf_18">To grant access permissions to users, you first create <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_22">policies.</span> Each policy defines a particular set of access permissions. You can then link users to policies to grant them the associated access permissions.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_19">Whenever a user makes an access request in Uptempo Campaign Management, the access control system dynamically decides whether to grant or deny the request, using this process:</p><ol class="list _decimal" id="-mgg4lf_20" type="1"><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_23"><p id="-mgg4lf_27">A user requests access to an activity.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_24"><p id="-mgg4lf_28">The system retrieves all the access control policies that the user is linked to.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_25"><p id="-mgg4lf_29">The system evaluates the policies to decide whether the user has permission to receive the requested access.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_26"><p id="-mgg4lf_30">The system grants or denies access based on the outcome of the evaluation.</p></li></ol><p id="-mgg4lf_21">For example, say a user opens the details panel of a particular activity: if the user's policies give permission to see the activity's details, the system will display those details to the user; otherwise, the system hides the details from the user.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="statements" data-toc="statements">Statements</h3><p id="-mgg4lf_31">To define the exact permissions that a policy grants, you create <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_34">statements</span>. A policy can contain one or multiple statements, and each statement defines a particular scope of access: for example, a statement might grant full access to create, edit, or delete all activities, or it might only grant access to view activities of a specified type.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_32">Statements are <span class="emphasis" id="-mgg4lf_35">additive</span>, which means a policy grants the sum of all its statements added together. In cases where two applicable statements have an overlapping scope (e.g. the same activity type), the statement which grants <span class="emphasis" id="-mgg4lf_36">more</span> access is the one that will take effect. Additionally, users can be linked to multiple policies, so users are granted the combination of the statements across all the policies they are linked to.</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="note" data-title="Note" id="-mgg4lf_33"><p id="-mgg4lf_37">&quot;Requesting access&quot; consists of both actions that the user actively performs, and implied requests that the user may not even be aware of. To ensure both data security and a seamless user experience, the system is designed to adjust its behavior in a way that is transparent to the user based on their permissions.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_38">For example, if a user has view permission but not edit permission for an activity, the system does not wait until the user tries to make a change to the activity. Instead, the system proactively hides the <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_39">Edit</span> buttons on the activity for that user.</p></aside></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="how-are-activity-access-control-statements-structured" data-toc="how-are-activity-access-control-statements-structured">How are activity access control statements structured?</h2><p id="-mgg4lf_40">Uptempo's activity access controls are based on the <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_44">Attribute-Based Access Control</span> (ABAC) model.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_41">An ABAC access control system makes access decisions by evaluating the characteristics (<span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_45">attributes</span>) of the users and resources involved in an access control request. As a result, Uptempo Campaign Management's activity access control statements are structured around attributes of users and activities.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="what-is-attribute-based-access-control-abac" data-toc="what-is-attribute-based-access-control-abac">What is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)?</h3><p id="-mgg4lf_46">To understand how Uptempo's activity access controls work, it's helpful to understand some basics about Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).</p><p id="-mgg4lf_47">Like all access control models, ABAC is centered around the concept of protecting <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_54">resources</span> by deciding which <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_55">users</span> are allowed to perform specific <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_56">actions</span> on those resources:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-mgg4lf_48"><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_57"><p id="-mgg4lf_60"><span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_61">Resources</span> are the objects that the ABAC system is protecting. In Uptempo Campaign Management, these are your activities and their data.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_58"><p id="-mgg4lf_62"><span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_63">Users</span> are the entities who are requesting access to the resources. In Uptempo Campaign Management, these are user accounts with access to Uptempo Campaign Management (the <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_64">Activities</span> section).</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_59"><p id="-mgg4lf_65"><span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_66">Actions</span> are the operations that users are requesting to perform on a resource, such as viewing, creating, editing, deleting, etc. In Uptempo Campaign Management, these actions include the basic user operations such as viewing or creating an activity, but can also be defined more specifically: for example, placing an activity in the hierarchy as a child of another activity is an action that can be defined and controlled.</p></li></ul><p id="-mgg4lf_49">When a user makes a request to the system to perform an action on a resource, the ABAC system looks at the <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_67">attributes</span> of the user and resource involved:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-mgg4lf_50"><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_68"><p id="-mgg4lf_69"><span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_70">Attributes</span> are characteristics of the entities involved: the user who is making the request, and the resource involved in the request. In Uptempo Campaign Management, these are typically properties of activities, such as the activity type (user properties are not currently supported as ABAC attributes).</p></li></ul><p id="-mgg4lf_51">The ABAC system then looks at the user's policies, and the statements they contain. Each statement is a rule that defines certain attribute-based requirements, and specifies an access control effect (allow or deny) that is applied when these requirements are met.</p><p id="-mgg4lf_52">To make an access control decision, the ABAC system compares the attributes of the user and the requested resource, and evaluates them against the user's access control policies. If the user is linked to a policy that defines a statement for the attributes involved, the ABAC system grants (or denies) access accordingly.</p><dl id="-mgg4lf_53" data-style="title-top"><dt id="-mgg4lf_71" data-expandable="false">Example</dt><dd><p id="-mgg4lf_72">Assume a user has an access control statement that says:</p><p id="-mgg4lf_73"><span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_78">ALLOW</span> users in the location <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_79">EUROPE</span> to <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_80">VIEW</span> resources with the type <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_81">DOCUMENT.</span></p><p id="-mgg4lf_74">If that user makes an access request where:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-mgg4lf_75"><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_82"><p id="-mgg4lf_85">The user's requested <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_86">Action</span> is: <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_87">VIEW</span></p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_83"><p id="-mgg4lf_88">The user's <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_89">Location</span> attribute is: <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_90">EUROPE</span></p></li><li class="list__item" id="-mgg4lf_84"><p id="-mgg4lf_91">The requested resource's <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_92">Type</span> attribute is: <span class="control" id="-mgg4lf_93">DOCUMENT</span></p></li></ul><p id="-mgg4lf_76">Then this statement would take effect, because all the statement's requirements are met by the access request.
