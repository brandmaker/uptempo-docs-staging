Instead of only being able to grant full access to all activities of a given activity type or type group, you can now set conditions that pinpoint specific activities based on their attributes. For example, you can use conditions to give users access only to activities relevant to their geographic region or department. By combining multiple conditions, you can get as granular as needed to tailor access levels to your organizations exact needs.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-wxuxww_28"><p id="-wxuxww_33"><span class="control" id="-wxuxww_34">View Action</span>: Previously, access controls only allowed you to grant full access to activities &mdash; to see an activity, a user also had to have the ability to create or edit that activity. Using the new <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_35">View</span> action, you can now easily set up read-only access for users who need to be able to see an activity's details, but shouldn't have the ability to modify the activity.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-wxuxww_29"><p id="-wxuxww_36"><span class="control" id="-wxuxww_37">Set Activity As Child Of Action</span>: To help maintain the integrity of complex activity hierarchies, the new <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_38">Set Activity As Child Of</span> action allows you to define exactly where in the hierarchy users can place activities. This means that users can only select hierarchy locations (parent activities) that have been predefined as valid whenever they create or move an activity, ensuring that your business logic is consistently enforced.</p></li></ul><p id="-wxuxww_26"><a href="activity-access-control-config-overview.html" id="-wxuxww_39" data-tooltip="Activity access controls are rules that govern access to your Campaign Management activities and their associated data.">Learn more about configuring access controls for activities</a></p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="create-attribute-dependency-chains" data-toc="create-attribute-dependency-chains">Create Attribute Dependency Chains</h3><p id="-wxuxww_40">When you configure attributes for your activity types, you can now connect multiple (non-required) attribute dependencies together to create multi-level dependency chains.</p><p id="-wxuxww_41">Previously, you could set up pairs of attributes where one was a &quot;controlling&quot; attribute for a second &quot;dependent&quot; attribute, for example a <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_43">Country</span> attribute might be set to control the values for a dependent <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_44">State</span> attribute &mdash; however, an attribute set as a dependent could not itself be set as the controlling attribute for a separate dependent attribute. That restriction has now been removed, which means that you can chain dependencies by setting any attribute as both a controlling and dependent attribute at the same time. For example, a <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_45">State</span> attribute could be the dependent of a <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_46">Country</span> attribute, and the controlling attribute for a <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_47">City</span> attribute, creating a <span class="control" id="-wxuxww_48">Country-City-State</span> dependency chain.</p><p id="-wxuxww_42"><a href="attribute-dependencies.html" id="-wxuxww_49" data-tooltip="If two Drop-Down List or Multi-Select List attributes are logically related, you can create an attribute dependency to link them.">Learn more about creating attribute dependencies</a></p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="keep-existing-funding-when-moving-activities" data-toc="keep-existing-funding-when-moving-activities">Keep Existing Funding When Moving Activities</h3><p id="-wxuxww_50">For activities that are connected to investments, moving an activity under a different parent activity that has incompatible funding no longer disconnects the moved activity's connected investment by default. This enhancement allows you to reorganize your investment-connected activities without the risk of unintentionally removing their funding.</p><p id="-wxuxww_51">Now, whenever you move an activity in this situation, you will be asked to choose if you want to keep the connection on the moved activity and adjust the new parent activity's investment connections to be compatible.
