Instead of only being able to grant full access to all activities of a given activity type or type group, you can now set conditions that pinpoint specific activities based on their attributes. For example, you can use conditions to give users access only to activities relevant to their geographic region or department. By combining multiple conditions, you can get as granular as needed to tailor access levels to your organizations exact needs.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-7fe4rp_27"><p id="-7fe4rp_32"><span class="control" id="-7fe4rp_33">View Action</span>: Previously, access controls only allowed you to grant full access to activities &mdash; to see an activity, a user also had to have the ability to create or edit that activity.

That restriction has now been removed, which means that you can chain dependencies by setting any attribute as both a controlling and dependent attribute at the same time. For example, a <span class="control" id="-7fe4rp_44">State</span> attribute could be the dependent of a <span class="control" id="-7fe4rp_45">Country</span> attribute, and the controlling attribute for a <span class="control" id="-7fe4rp_46">City</span> attribute, creating a <span class="control" id="-7fe4rp_47">Country-City-State</span> dependency chain.</p><p id="-7fe4rp_41"><a href="attribute-dependencies.html" id="-7fe4rp_48" data-tooltip="If two Drop-Down List or Multi-Select List attributes are logically related, you can create an attribute dependency to link them.">Learn more about creating attribute dependencies</a></p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="keep-existing-funding-when-moving-activities" data-toc="keep-existing-funding-when-moving-activities">Keep Existing Funding When Moving Activities</h3><p id="-7fe4rp_49">For activities that are connected to investments, moving an activity under a different parent activity that has incompatible funding no longer disconnects the moved activity's connected investment by default. This enhancement allows you to reorganize your investment-connected activities without the risk of unintentionally removing their funding.</p><p id="-7fe4rp_50">Now, whenever you move an activity in this situation, you will be asked to choose if you want to keep the connection on the moved activity and adjust the new parent activity's investment connections to be compatible.
