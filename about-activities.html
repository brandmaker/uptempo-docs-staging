An activity can correspond to a high-level initiative (such as a plan, campaign, or program), or to an individual execution, such as a specific tactic. Regardless of its level, each activity is configured, scheduled, tracked, and measured so you can understand its contribution to inquiries, pipeline, and overall marketing impact.</p><p id="iprje4_5">In Uptempo Campaign Management, activities are organized into a hierarchy and displayed in the <span class="control" id="iprje4_15">Activities</span> section:</p><figure id="iprje4_6"><a href="images/Activity%20Representation.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Activity Representation" src="images/Activity%20Representation.png" title="Activity Representation" width="450" height="192"></a></figure><p id="iprje4_7">For example, a common hierarchy includes levels like:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_8"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_16"><p id="iprje4_20">Plan</p></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_17"><p id="iprje4_21">Campaign</p></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_18"><p id="iprje4_22">Program</p></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_19"><p id="iprje4_23">Tactic</p></li></ul><p id="iprje4_9">The structure of your activity hierarchy is defined during implementation in collaboration with your organization's marketing team to ensure it reflects how you plan and manage marketing initiatives. This flexible approach allows Uptempo to support a wide range of marketing models while maintaining consistent planning, measurement, and reporting across all activities.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="hierarchy-paths-and-relationships" data-toc="hierarchy-paths-and-relationships">Hierarchy paths and relationships</h2><p id="iprje4_24">To clarify how hierarchies work in Uptempo, it is helpful to understand the concept of a hierarchy <span class="emphasis" id="iprje4_37">path</span>.</p><dl id="iprje4_25" data-style="title-top"><dt id="iprje4_38" data-expandable="false"><span class="control" id="iprje4_41">Path</span></dt><dd><p id="iprje4_40">The direct sequence of connected activities that runs from the highest level of the hierarchy down to a specific activity at a lower level. Each unique route formed by these linkages forms a distinct path through the hierarchy.</p></dd></dl><p id="iprje4_26">In a tree diagram of an activity hierarchy, a path is visualized as a series of lines that connects a sequence of activities vertically through the hierarchy. The following image illustrates multiple paths:</p><figure id="iprje4_27"><img alt="Path Definition" src="images/Path%20Definition.png" title="Path Definition" width="237" height="284"></figure><p id="iprje4_28">In this example, two paths are highlighted. Both start at <span class="control" id="iprje4_42">Plan A</span> and branch to different tactics: one path ends at <span class="control" id="iprje4_43">Tactic LA</span>, the other path ends at <span class="control" id="iprje4_44">Tactic SN</span>. Any valid connection from <span class="control" id="iprje4_45">Plan A</span> to a downstream activity represents a path.</p><p id="iprje4_29">Paths can share portions of the hierarchy. The next image shows three paths that overlap:</p><figure id="iprje4_30"><img alt="Path Sharing" src="images/Path%20Sharing.png" title="Path Sharing" width="165" height="284"></figure><p id="iprje4_31">In this case, all three paths pass through <span class="control" id="iprje4_46">Campaign Q</span> and <span class="control" id="iprje4_47">Program FT</span>. This is important, because actions taken on <span class="control" id="iprje4_48">Campaign Q</span> or <span class="control" id="iprje4_49">Program FT</span> affect every path that includes those activities.</p><p id="iprje4_32">Hierarchies also distinguish between ancestors and descendants, based on a defined reference activity (or &quot;starting point&quot;). In the following example, the reference activity is <span class="control" id="iprje4_50">Program FT</span>:</p><figure id="iprje4_33"><img alt="Ances Desc Def" src="images/Ances%20Desc%20Def.png" title="Ances Desc Def" width="316" height="284"></figure><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_34"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_51"><p id="iprje4_54">All activities upstream from the reference activity are collectively called <span class="emphasis" id="iprje4_56">ancestors</span>.</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_55"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_57"><p id="iprje4_58">In this example, <span class="control" id="iprje4_59">Plan A</span> and <span class="control" id="iprje4_60">Campaign Q</span> are ancestors of <span class="control" id="iprje4_61">Program FT</span>.</p></li></ul></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_52"><p id="iprje4_62">All activities downstream from the reference activity are collectively called <span class="emphasis" id="iprje4_64">descendants</span>.</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_63"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_65"><p id="iprje4_66">In this example, <span class="control" id="iprje4_67">Tactic SN</span>, <span class="control" id="iprje4_68">Tactic TB</span>, and <span class="control" id="iprje4_69">Tactic WA</span> are descendants of <span class="control" id="iprje4_70">Program FT</span>.</p></li></ul></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_53"><p id="iprje4_71">The immediate ancestor of an activity is referred to as its <span class="emphasis" id="iprje4_73">parent</span>, and any immediate descendant is a <span class="emphasis" id="iprje4_74">child</span>.</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_72"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_75"><p id="iprje4_76">In this example, <span class="control" id="iprje4_77">Campaign Q</span> is a parent of <span class="control" id="iprje4_78">Program FT</span>, and <span class="control" id="iprje4_79">Program FT</span> is a child of <span class="control" id="iprje4_80">Campaign Q</span>.</p></li></ul></li></ul><aside class="prompt" data-type="note" data-title="Note" id="iprje4_35"><p id="iprje4_81">Investments in <span class="control" id="iprje4_82">Uptempo Financial Management</span> are also arranged in a hierarchy.

Attributes are the individual fields that capture information about an activity, such as dates, target audience, product, objective, etc. The specific set of attributes that is attached to an activity is determined by the activity type, so activity types are effectively templates for different kinds of activities. Some attributes are required, while others are optional, depending on how the activity type is configured.</p><p id="iprje4_97">All activity types have the following basic attributes:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="iprje4_98"><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_102"><p id="iprje4_106"><span class="control" id="iprje4_107">Name</span>: The activity's name, as shown in the activity hierarchy.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_103"><p id="iprje4_108"><span class="control" id="iprje4_109">Type</span>: The type of activity, which defines the activity's attributes and where it can be placed in the hierarchy.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="iprje4_104"><p id="iprje4_110"><span class="control" id="iprje4_111">In-Market Dates</span>: The time period during which the activity is expected to be executed in the market.
