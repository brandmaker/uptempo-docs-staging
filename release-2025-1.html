Previously, Estimated Costs would only roll up one level: an activity displayed a roll-up total if its child activities (one level down) had Estimated Costs set, but not if the Estimated Costs were set on activities two levels down or lower. Now, activities always display an Estimated Costs roll-up total, no matter how many levels down the values are set. For example, the top-level activity will display a roll-up total even if all the Estimated Costs are set only on activities at the bottom of the hierarchy, six or seven levels down. And just like before, if an activity on a level in between has its own Estimated Costs value set, this value will override the roll-up total for that level, and will be used to calculate roll-up totals for levels above it.</p><p id="-908ste_20"><a href="track-and-analyze-budgets.html" id="-908ste_21" data-tooltip="In Uptempo Campaign Management, Estimated Costs and Connect to Spend help you to plan, track, and evaluate your marketing budgets more effectively.">Learn more about working with Estimated Costs</a></p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="summary-display-mode-performance-improvements" data-toc="summary-display-mode-performance-improvements">Summary display mode performance improvements</h3><p id="-908ste_22">We have implemented a variety of performance optimizations to ensure that the Summary display mode loads quickly and remains responsive, even if the table contains hundreds of activities.</p><p id="-908ste_23"><a href="get-started-campaign.html" id="-908ste_24" data-tooltip="Uptempo Campaign Management is the system of record for your marketing activities.

The new system consists of two reports: one in Tableau, which contains comprehensive user and budget data (i.e. login dates, names, etc.); and one in GoodData, which contains data about user roles and permissions. By using these two reports in tandem, administrators can maintain complete oversight of user management and access. This release makes the Tableau report available, joining the GoodData report that was previously released in the October 2024 release.</p><figure id="-908ste_61"><img alt="User permission report" src="images/UserPermissionReport.png" title="User permission report" width="2416" height="870"></figure><p id="-908ste_62"><a href="https://knowledge.uptempo.io/doc/BM_Uptempo_en_700100000000/Content/Home.htm" id="-908ste_63" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Learn more about User Permission Report</a></p></section></section><div class="last-modified">19 January 2026</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="deprecations-and-discontinuations-2025-2.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Deprecations and Discontinuations: 2025.2</a><a href="hive9-release-2025-november.html" class="navigation-links__next">Release: November 2025</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.25.3-b857/app.js"></script></body></html>
