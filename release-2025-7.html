Before, you could not use an attribute as a dependent attribute if it was required on any activity type. This update removes that restriction, so that you can now make any dependent attribute required. In dependency chains of multiple linked attributes, this means you can make dependent attributes <span class="control" id="-msjzmo_61">conditionally</span> required: they're required only after certain values are selected in the controlling attribute. Together with this release's other improvements to attribute dependencies, this change makes it possible to build dynamic, streamlined forms in the activity Details panel that significantly reduce the time needed to create an activity.</p><figure id="-msjzmo_59"><a href="images/RequiredDependentAttribute.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Required dependent attribute" src="images/RequiredDependentAttribute.png" title="Required dependent attribute" width="450" height="115"></a></figure><p id="-msjzmo_60"><a href="attribute-dependencies.html" id="-msjzmo_62" data-tooltip="If two Drop-Down List or Multi-Select List attributes are logically related, you can create an attribute dependency to link them.">Learn more about these attribute dependency enhancements</a></p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="campaign-management-activities" data-toc="campaign-management-activities">Campaign Management: Activities</h2><section class="chapter"><h3 id="user-experience-enhancements-for-attribute-dependencies" data-toc="user-experience-enhancements-for-attribute-dependencies" data-label-id="preview">User experience enhancements for attribute dependencies</h3><p id="-msjzmo_65">We've made several UX improvements in the details panel to make it easier and faster to work with attribute dependencies, and to support required dependent attributes:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-msjzmo_66"><li class="list__item" id="-msjzmo_68"><p id="-msjzmo_71"><span class="control" id="-msjzmo_72">Grouped attribute controls for dependencies:</span> If an activity type includes one or more attribute dependencies, the details panel now groups all attributes that are part of a dependency into their own section, and visually shows how the attributes are linked to one another. Within this section, the system does not auto-save attribute values as soon as they are selected. Instead, values are only saved when you click <span class="control" id="-msjzmo_73">Save</span>: this helps to protect data integrity by ensuring that all required dependent attributes have a value selected before changes are saved in the system. <figure id="-msjzmo_74"><a href="images/RequiredDependentAttribute2.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Required dependent attribute2" src="images/RequiredDependentAttribute2.png" title="Required dependent attribute2" width="450" height="319"></a></figure></p></li><li class="list__item" id="-msjzmo_69"><p id="-msjzmo_75"><span class="control" id="-msjzmo_76">Dynamically hidden dependent attribute fields</span>: In chained dependencies that contain multiple linked attributes, the system now automatically hides all dependent attributes until they're needed. For example, if a conditionally required dependent attribute is only valid for certain values in the controlling attribute, it is initially not shown in the details panel: it only becomes visible after you select one of the controlling attribute values that make it required.
