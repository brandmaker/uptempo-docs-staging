Within this section, the system does not auto-save attribute values as soon as they are selected. Instead, values are only saved when you click <span class="control" id="a39ifa_200">Save</span>: this helps to protect data integrity by ensuring that all required dependent attributes have a value selected before changes are saved in the system. <figure id="a39ifa_201"><a href="images/RequiredDependentAttribute2.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Required dependent attribute2" src="images/RequiredDependentAttribute2.png" title="Required dependent attribute2" width="450" height="319"></a></figure></p></li><li class="list__item" id="a39ifa_196"><p id="a39ifa_202"><span class="control" id="a39ifa_203">Dynamically hidden dependent attribute fields</span>: In chained dependencies that contain multiple linked attributes, the system now automatically hides all dependent attributes until they're needed. For example, if a conditionally required dependent attribute is only valid for certain values in the controlling attribute, it is initially not shown in the details panel: it only becomes visible after you select one of the controlling attribute values that make it required. This simplifies the details panel, and makes it easier to use for activity types with a lot of attributes.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="a39ifa_197"><p id="a39ifa_204"><span class="control" id="a39ifa_205">Auto-select dependent attribute values</span>: The system now saves you unnecessary clicks when a dependent attribute only has one possible value.
