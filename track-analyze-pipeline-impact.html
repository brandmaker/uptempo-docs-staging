By entering the demand an activity is intended to generate into this impact model, you can create projections of how your initiatives are likely to influence revenue over time. This makes it easier to align marketing plans with organizational goals and to communicate expected value to stakeholders.</p><p id="-eyj24f_6">Impact modeling also supports better decision-making during planning. By making the expected impact of activities visible upfront, you can prioritize activities with the greatest potential return, and adjust plans before resources are committed. As execution progresses, Impact Modeler provides a reference point for evaluating whether activities are performing as expected, and where corrective action may be needed.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="how-impact-modeling-works" data-toc="how-impact-modeling-works">How impact modeling works</h2><p id="-eyj24f_12">During the planning phase, you can capture the number of inquiries or leads an activity is expected to generate. These assumptions are fed into a model of your demand funnel (which includes typical conversion rates between funnel stages, velocity, and average deal sizes). The model uses these inputs to project anticipated revenue from an activity, and the timing of that revenue.</p><p id="-eyj24f_13">During the execution phase, you can record actual results for inquiries or leads created by the same activities, as well as for revenue generated by closed/won deals. By comparing targets and results in real time, you can quickly see what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not, so that you can make informed decisions about how to adjust your strategy.</p><p id="-eyj24f_14">You can enter impact data for planned targets and actual results at any level of your activity hierarchy. All impact data automatically aggregates up to the top of the activity hierarchy along <a href="about-activities.html#hierarchy-paths-and-relationships" id="-eyj24f_16" data-tooltip="To clarify how hierarchies work in Uptempo, it is helpful to understand the concept of a hierarchy path.">hierarchy paths</a>, so you can get full insight into performance at every level of your marketing plan.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="about-the-impact-model" data-toc="about-the-impact-model">About the impact model</h3><p id="-eyj24f_17">Your Uptempo administrator sets up the impact model that the system uses to generate projections. The impact model consists of the following parts:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-eyj24f_18"><li class="list__item" id="-eyj24f_20"><p id="-eyj24f_23">A model of your organization's <span class="control" id="-eyj24f_24">demand generation funnel</span>. This model defines the stages that you track as customers move through the sales pipeline, from lead to closed/won deal.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-eyj24f_21"><p id="-eyj24f_25">Default <span class="control" id="-eyj24f_26">funnel performance assumptions</span>, such as typical conversion rates (the rate at which leads move from one funnel stage to the next), velocities (how fast they move between stages), and the average value of a closed/won deal.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-eyj24f_22"><p id="-eyj24f_27"><span class="control" id="-eyj24f_28">Scenario-based overrides</span> for the default assumptions, based on activity attributes. For example, you can set overrides for scenarios such as if the average deal size for a given product is higher or lower, or if deals in a particular market close faster or slower.</p></li></ul><p id="-eyj24f_19">When you enter a planned demand target for an activity, Uptempo plugs this input into the impact model and generates a projection of how much revenue the activity is expected to generate, and when. To do this, it uses scenario-based performance assumptions if available (determined by the attributes set on the activity), or otherwise uses the default assumptions if no available scenario applies.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="view-activity-impact-data" data-toc="view-activity-impact-data">View activity impact data</h2><p id="-eyj24f_29">For each activity, the <span class="control" id="-eyj24f_31">Impact</span> section of the activity's details panel contains its impact data.
